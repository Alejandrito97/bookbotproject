# bookbotproject

Hello, bookbot is my first project. 

This is the second attempt to make this script. Purpose was to make sure I understand the concept of the exercise and to see if I will be able to finish the project successfully again and what will be the difference in final code compared to first attempt.

What I have found out is:
- In first attempt I made a mistake with .gitignore file -> syntax error
- Second difference is that I have coded function for dictionary to list conversion -> in this second attempt I just simply wrote a line of code to make it work (personally I prefer the function so I find the first code better).

The rest of the code is pretty much the same (structurally) so I find this second attempt successful.

Cheers.
